## What is XRDocs?

> It's a tool that offer you the unity project documentation, ready to read and distribute.

## How do you made it?

XRDocs works from the scratch of your project source code. Trough a series of python scripts organized as a pipe & filters architecture, we analyze your source code to obtain important informations on your project, providing you a ready to use documentation.

See the [documentation](main-details.md) for the results of your Unity3d project scanning.

## Features

- Scene Graphs.
- Differents Views.
- Script Analysis.
- Annidate View.
- XMLs of your projects.
- YAML ready to parse.

## Why do you started developing that?

In our researches among the web, studying augmented and extended reality, we bumped into a bunch of forum discussions where developers were looking for something to document their projects and their code without efforts and time-losing operations.

This is only a starting point for many researches on reverse engineering and automatical documentation production.

## Future improvements

We are thinking of going on and continue the development of this powerful tool, so we are working hard to improve and add many features like:

- Script-to-MonoBehavioural automatic linking.
- Reading and rendering of graphical models in documentation.
- Totally automatical documentation creation.
- So on...
